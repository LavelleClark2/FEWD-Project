Based on the Dragon Ball franchise, it was released for the PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Microsoft Windows in most regions in January 2018, and in Japan the following month, and was released worldwide for the Nintendo Switch in September 2018.</p>



        <p class="text-primary text-center">Dragon Ball FighterZ involves the player picking a team of 3 playable characters and a unique assist for each, then fighting an AI or human opponent with their own team of 3 characters. The game received positive reviews from critics, with many citing the game as one of the best fighting games released in the eighth generation of video game consoles. The game's fighting system, character roster, visuals, story mode, and music were all highly praised while its online functionality was criticized.
